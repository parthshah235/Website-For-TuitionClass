        <p  style="text-align: justify; padding: 7px;"><font face="OpenSans" size="5px">Educare- A place where you get to learn everything under a single roof. It is an institute providing
education to students of GSEB, CBSE and ICSE board and of all grades. The institute provides
education at two centres – Bopal and Bodakdev with its highly experienced faculties. The institute
provides tuitions for all the subjects. Educare has helped 1453 students in achieving their goals since
last 10 years.</font></p>
 <p  style="text-align: justify; padding: 7px;"><font face="OpenSans" size="5px">At Educare we emphasize on creative learning rather than typical learning practices. Our teachers
focus on making students understand the subject in depth with the help of videos and presentations
so that they build interest in the subject and thus learning becomes easy.</font></p>
 <p  style="text-align: justify; padding: 7px;"><font face="OpenSans" size="5px">According to our teaching scheme, we have an hour’s practice session every day. During that time
students are given practice sheets which consist of revision of the topics taught in the class. During
practice hour a tutor is always present in the class to help students if they have any confusion or
wants to understand any topic.</font></p>
 <p  style="text-align: justify; padding: 7px;"><font face="OpenSans" size="5px">Chapter wise tests and weekly tests are conducted at our institute and scores are reported through
messages and Educare portal. Records of all grades are maintained at the institute which helps in
supervising growth of the student.</font></p>
 <p  style="text-align: justify; padding: 7px;"><font face="OpenSans" size="5px">We provide notes to the student for reference, practice and learning purpose. Other creative ways
of educating are also adopted by our teachers to make learning more fun rather than a stressful task
for kids. </font></p>
